Hi, I'm a Builder of Unusual Ideas 👨‍💻

I enjoy building systems that are a little off the beaten path — not just functional, but clever, efficient, and often custom-tailored to specific needs. Whether it's encoding data in non-standard visual forms or designing systems that feel right rather than just work, I like making tech that thinks differently.

🧠 How I Think
I overanalyze things — not because I’m unsure, but because I want to understand every corner of a problem before I solve it.

I find perfection satisfying, not stressful. Clean structure, elegant code, and well-planned architecture are more than aesthetics — they bring peace.

I often choose to build things from scratch, even when libraries exist. It’s not about reinventing the wheel — it’s about knowing how the wheel spins.

Automation and customization are at the core of my workflow. If something can be optimized or made smarter, I’ll probably do it.

🔍 What I Like to Build
Systems with custom logic and design — like shape-based encodings, unique CAPTCHA challenges, or hybrid visual codes.

APIs that are self-hosted and independent, giving full control without relying on third-party services.

Interfaces that are minimal but functional, usually with just the right amount of UI polish.

⚙️ Tech Preferences
Languages: JavaScript, PHP, Python

Environment: Node.js, MySQL, Canvas, HTML/CSS

Philosophy: Build light, think deep, automate smart

I'm not in a rush to build everything — I prefer doing things right, my way. If that means taking the longer route to understand the roots of a problem, so be it.

Thanks for visiting my corner of GitHub 👋
