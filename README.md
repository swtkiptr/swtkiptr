# Hi, I'm a Builder of Unusual Ideas 👨‍💻

I enjoy building systems that are a little off the beaten path — not just functional, but clever, efficient, and often custom-tailored to specific needs. Whether it's encoding data in non-standard visual forms or designing systems that feel right rather than just work, I like making tech that thinks differently.

## 🧠 How I Think

- I overanalyze things — not because I’m unsure, but because I want to understand every corner of a problem before I solve it.
- I find perfection satisfying, not stressful. Clean structure, elegant code, and well-planned architecture are more than aesthetics — they bring peace.
- I often choose to build things from scratch, even when libraries exist. It’s not about reinventing the wheel — it’s about knowing how the wheel spins.
- Automation and customization are at the core of my workflow. If something can be optimized or made smarter, I’ll probably do it.

## 🔍 What I Like to Build

- Systems with custom logic and design — like shape-based encodings, unique CAPTCHA challenges, or hybrid visual codes.
- APIs that are self-hosted and independent, giving full control without relying on third-party services.
- Interfaces that are minimal but functional, usually with just the right amount of UI polish.

## ⚙️ Tech Preferences

- **Languages:** JavaScript, PHP, Python
- **Environment:** Node.js, MySQL, Canvas, HTML/CSS
- **Philosophy:** Build light, think deep, automate smart

I'm not in a rush to build everything — I prefer doing things right, my way. If that means taking the longer route to understand the roots of a problem, so be it.
