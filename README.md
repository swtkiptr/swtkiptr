Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
I like building weirdly fun, sometimes overly structured things

🛠 My Tools of Choice:
JavaScript | Node.js | PHP | Python | React
(And a sprinkle of overthinking for that perfect touch.)

✨ Motto:
"Why make it normal, when you can make it yours?"

Let’s keep things clean, clever, and a bit chaotic 🤘
Thanks for stopping by—drop a ⭐ if you find something you like!
